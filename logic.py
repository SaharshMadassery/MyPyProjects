                **Neuro-Architecture Considerations:**
                - Spatial Arrangement: Stations designed to minimize distractions and enhance individual concentration.
                - Clear Pathways: Unobstructed movement for supervisors and students, reducing stress.
                - Cognitive Load Management: Logical placement of equipment to reduce mental strain.

                **Neuro-Aesthetics for Exam Optimization:**
                - Color Psychology: Neutral colors (light gray, off-white) to promote calmness and reduce anxiety.
                - Lighting: Balanced natural and artificial lighting (500-700 lux) to avoid glare and eye strain.
                - Acoustics: Minimal noise interference with sound-absorbing panels for focus enhancement.
                - Temperature & Air Quality: Maintained at an optimal 20-22°C with fresh airflow to support cognitive function.

                - Space Optimization: The workstation is arranged to minimize distractions, offering a personal workspace for each user. This layout promotes focus and cognitive efficiency.
                - Explanation: (A well-spaced environment reduces cognitive overload by providing clear, unobstructed views of tasks and minimizing environmental clutter.)
                - Ergonomic Workstations: Adjustable desks and chairs to support comfort during long coding sessions.
                - Explanation: (Proper posture and comfort optimize cognitive performance, especially for tasks that require focus for extended periods.)
                
                **Neuro-Aesthetics:**
                - Color Scheme: Neutral tones (e.g., light gray or soft blue) used for walls and furniture to enhance concentration and reduce stress.
                - Explanation: (Colors like blue and gray have been shown to foster calm and concentration, helping to maintain focus in environments where prolonged mental effort is required.)
                - Lighting: Bright but diffused lighting (around 500 lux) with adjustable brightness.
                - Explanation: (Proper lighting reduces eye strain, allowing students to maintain focus without distractions, improving cognitive function.)
                - Sound Management: Soft background music or white noise, ensuring a quiet but not sterile atmosphere.
                - Explanation: (White noise helps mask distractions and enhances the ability to focus, particularly in environments where multiple students work independently.)
                - Visibility of Tools & Materials: Coding reference materials and other necessary resources are easily accessible without overwhelming the workspace.
                - Explanation: (Ensuring materials are within arm's reach without cluttering the workspace supports cognitive flow, as it reduces the need to search for resources, allowing a continuous thought process.)
